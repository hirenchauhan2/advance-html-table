# Advance HTML Table / Data-grid

Adding super powers to HTML tables with vanilla JS and CSS. This is an exercise to learn what goes into building highly performant data-grid/data-tables using JS and CSS.

This is a very simple table having sorting, pagination functionalities for now. I will try to add column filtering, dynamic table configuration for headers and more features to it in coming time.

**Note**: This is not a library or any other tool, this is just for my practice and for inspiration. You can take a look at the code, use it in your projects on your own risks!
